# kickstarter_regression
A school project coded by me to see whether the success of kickstarter projects could be explained/predicted beforehand, based only on project parameters.
Success rate is used as a numeric variable for the response variable, therefore, simple linear regression model was used.
Presentation material is in Hungarian.
